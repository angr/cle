CLE
===
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

CLE loads binaries and their associated libraries, resolves imports and
provides an abstraction of process memory the same way as if it was loader by
the OS's loader.

# Installation

`$ pip install cle`

# Usage example

```python
>>> import cle
>>> ld = cle.Loader("/bin/ls")
>>> hex(ld.main_object.entry)
'0x4048d0'
>>> ld.shared_objects
{'ld-linux-x86-64.so.2': <ELF Object ld-2.21.so, maps [0x5000000:0x522312f]>,
 'libacl.so.1': <ELF Object libacl.so.1.1.0, maps [0x2000000:0x220829f]>,
 'libattr.so.1': <ELF Object libattr.so.1.1.0, maps [0x4000000:0x4204177]>,
 'libc.so.6': <ELF Object libc-2.21.so, maps [0x3000000:0x33a1a0f]>,
 'libcap.so.2': <ELF Object libcap.so.2.24, maps [0x1000000:0x1203c37]>}
>>> ld.addr_belongs_to_object(0x5000000)
<ELF Object ld-2.21.so, maps [0x5000000:0x522312f]>
>>> libc_main_reloc = ld.main_object.imports['__libc_start_main']
>>> hex(libc_main_reloc.addr)       # Address of GOT entry for libc_start_main
'0x61c1c0'
>>> import pyvex
>>> some_text_data = ld.memory.load(ld.main_object.entry, 0x100)
>>> irsb = pyvex.lift(some_text_data, ld.main_object.entry, ld.main_object.arch)
>>> irsb.pp()

# Valid options

For a full listing and description of the options that can be provided to the
loader and the methods it provides, please examine the docstrings in
`cle/loader.py`. If anything is unclear or poorly documented (there is much)
please complain through whatever channel you feel appropriate.

# Loading Backends

CLE's loader is implemented in the Loader class.
There are several backends that can be used to load a single file:

    - ELF, as its name says, loads ELF binaries. ELF files loaded this way are
      statically parsed using PyElfTools.

    - PE is a backend to load Microsoft's Portable Executable format,
      effectively Windows binaries. It uses the (optional) `pefile` module.

    - Mach-O is a backend to load, you guessed it, Mach-O binaries. It is
      subject to several limitations, which you can read about in the
      [readme in the macho directory](backends/macho/README.md)

    - Blob is a backend to load unknown data. It requires that you specify
      the architecture it would be run on, in the form of a class from
      ArchInfo.

Which backend you use can be specified as an argument to Loader. If left
unspecified, the loader will pick a reasonable default.

# Finding shared libraries

- If the `auto_load_libs` option is set to False, the Loader will not
  automatically load libraries requested by loaded objects. Otherwise...
- The loader determines which shared objects are needed when loading
  binaries, and searches for them in the following order:
    - in the current working directory
    - in folders specified in the `ld_path` option
    - in the same folder as the main binary
    - in the system (in the corresponding library path for the architecture
      of the binary, e.g., /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/lib for ARM, note that
      you need to install cross libraries for this, e.g.,
      libc6-powerpc-cross on Debian - needs emdebian repos)
    - in the system, but with mismatched version numbers from what is specified
      as a dependency, if the `ignore_import_version_numbers` option is True

- If no binary is found with the correct architecture, the loader raises an
  exception if `except_missing_libs` option is True. Otherwise it simply
  leaves the dependencies unresolved.
